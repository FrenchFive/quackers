        <h1 class="mb-4">About Quackers</h1>
        <p>Quackers is an open-source Discord bot written in Python. It provides fun commands like <code>/duck</code>, helpful utilities like <code>/info</code>, and AI features powered by OpenAI's GPT-4.1 and gpt-image-1 models.</p>
        <p>The project includes a web dashboard built with Flask for easy server configuration—from welcome messages and economy settings to mini-games and AI options. All configuration is stored in a SQLite database.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">About the Creator</h2>
        <p>The mastermind behind Quackers goes by the name FIVE — a French VFX artist, code wrangler, and digital mischief-maker with a soft spot for ducks and Discord chaos.</p>
        <p>By day, I craft explosions, simulations, and cinematic magic using Houdini. By night, I write Python scripts that turn servers into game shows. Whether I’m building water simulations that don’t behave or coding bots that behave too well, I live for that sweet spot where art and logic collide — ideally with sparks and maybe a small quack.</p>
        <p>Quackers is one of my side quests — born from the idea that Discord bots should do more than just sit quietly. I wanted to create something that was playful, community-driven, and a little too obsessed with coin flips. Now it runs games, tracks your bets, and occasionally encourages gambling addiction (with fake currency, don't worry).</p>
        <p>Known online as FIVE, I wear many hats: FX artist, indie dev, Twitch streamer (on break — blame my overheating PC), and AI experimenter. I’ve built tools, bots, even a painting app that makes your lines smoother based on stroke velocity. Why? Because I can’t stop building — and because I love giving digital things personality.</p>
        <p>Quackers is my way of sharing a bit of myself with every server it joins: slightly chaotic, highly interactive, and just smart enough to get dangerous.</p>
        <p>I am Lalaulune, Five's partner and sidekick, I got dragged (willingly) into the making of the website! On a daily basis, my favorite fields are history and litterature, but old memories of coding lessons allowed me to have a part in the project. Working on it was a way to learn a lot about coding and earn a lot of headaches trying to understand. I coded the front-end of the website. </p>
