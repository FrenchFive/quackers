## INSTALLATION AND SETUP GUIDE

Welcome to **Quackers**, a bot designed to bring quacking fun to your projects! Follow the steps below to install and run the bot successfully.

---

### PREREQUISITES:
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.X).
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. A terminal or command-line interface.

---

### INSTALLATION STEPS:

#### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrenchFive/quackers.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd quackers
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

> [!TIP]
> It is not necessary but **strongly** recommended.
> It allows the use of librairies in a specific configuration, meaning not breaking other code on other projects.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### RUNNING THE BOT:

#### 1. Configure the `.env` File
Quackers uses a file named `.env` to store all secret keys. This file should not be shared.

Example structure for `.env`:

```txt
KEY_OPENAI=sk-proj-1234567890abcdefg
KEY_DISCORD=1234567890abcdefg
```

- Generate an **OpenAI API Key** [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings).
- Get your **Discord Bot Token** by navigating to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and enabling necessary bot permissions.

A template of the file is available : `template.env`to help you create your `.env` file.

---

#### 2. Start the Bot
Run the bot script:

```bash
python backend/src/main.py
```

For additional support, open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FrenchFive/quackers/issues).

---

#### 3. Configure the server to monitor

Once the bot is launched and added to your discord channel, excecute the following /command in discord ```/admin-scan```

Answer all questions asked to personnalize your experience

```
Admin Role : The only role allowed to use "admin_..." /commands (except for "/admin-scan")
Newbie Role : The role assigned to New Members - allowing them access to "/presentation"
AFK Voice Channel : Voice Channel managed by discord - poeple going to this channel wont receive coins
General Channel : The main text channel of the server
Debugging Channel : Channel used to debug for dev 
Welcome Channel : Channel where Quackers will send Welcome Messages and Presentations from Members
Admin Info Channel : Channel used to share sensitive information to admin
```

For dev only - it is possible to access work-in-progress functions by modifying the `main.py`
<br><sub>`/admin-scan function displays the ID of the current server`</sub>
```python
# Server IDs
serverid = qdb.get_all_server_ids()
testid = [1159282148042350642] #server id for W.I.P functionnalities
``` 
It should match the server your [Server ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID)


> [!NOTE]
> It is necessary to RESTART the bot once the /admin-scan has been done.
> This way the server will be added to the list of servers to use the commands.

---

#### 4. Good Practices

It is strongly recommended to go in DISCORD into :
Server SETTINGS // Integrations // Quackers

And "Add Derogations" to all `/admin_...` commands 
And not allow @everyone to use them
